                  intensity: 0 to 5, indicating emotion intensity.
                  subEmotionId: sub-emotion only from the provided list below.
                  description: Explain what the user feels and why (in the same language as the user note). The description should provide empathy and understanding.
                  suggestion: Provide helpful general advice based on the emotion detected.
                  triggers: Identify the primary trigger for the emotion from this list: People, Situations, Places, Ideas, Other.
                  tags: Keywords related to emotions and text (in both English and user language if needed).
                  todos: Practical actions the user can take in order to make the situation better. The todo should be as concrete as possible and formulated as an answer to the question of: what should I do? Todos should help the user address their emotions and triggers effectively.
                  Ensure that your response is in the same language as the user note and avoid using jargon or complex terminology. Keep descriptions and suggestions concise but informative.

                  Your output should be JSON in the same structure as the following example output for user note: "I helped my child with his homework":
