                  The instructions related to todos in the prompt are:

                  Think about practical actions the user can take in order to make the situation better, or in another words a Todo action.
                  A todo should be formulated as an answer to the question of: what should I do?
                  Todos should help the user address their emotions and triggers effectively.
                  The format for todos in the JSON response includes the fields: title, description, and type.
                  The title field should be a concise summary of the todo action.
                  The description field should provide more context or steps to help the user complete the todo.
                  The type field can be used to categorize or differentiate between various types of todos.
